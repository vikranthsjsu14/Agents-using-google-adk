# Agents-using-google-adk

I ran the assignments A) on the google cloud so I couldn't retreive the code but I showed in each video. 

A.1) From Prototypes to Agents with ADK:
for this I did the lab with detail. I asked the agent about a plan and it generated it and stored it in the bucket which I have uploaded.

A.2) Building AI Agents with ADK: Empowering with Tools:
For this lab it was very simple just building an agent and api to have the agent do whatever I ask and also have a web UI accesibility as well.

A.3) Travel Agent:
This lab had two components to it where you do sql query and also building agent to help with travel and hotels. First I create MCP and then create a new directory for the agent.
